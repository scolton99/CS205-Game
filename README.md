# Assembly Language Game

Created for Northwestern COMP_SCI 205-0. Written in Microsoft Macro Assembler on x86 Assembly Language.

Some graphics and audio taken from Stardew Valley (since I'm a terrible artist and would have no hope of doing that myself).

## Installation
1. Install the [MASM32 SDK](https://www.masm32.com/).
2. Run `make.bat`.
3. Open `game.exe`.
